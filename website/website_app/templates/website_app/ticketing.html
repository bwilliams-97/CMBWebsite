        <h1>Charitable donations</h1>
        <p class="lead">We're delighted to have pledged to the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/whatsapound/">What's a Pound?</a> campaign this year.  This means that when you apply for your tickets, there is the option of donating an additional £1 (or even £5) to our two chosen charities. Such a small donation can go a long way to helping people within our community here in Cambridge.</p>
        <p class="lead"><strong>We would be extremely grateful if you could speak to your chosen guests about this campaign and whether they would like to support these worthy causes.</strong></p>

                <p class="lead"><strong><a href="http://www.redballoonlearner.org">Red Balloon</a></strong></p>
                <p class="lead">Red Balloon supports young people who self-exclude from education as a result of severe bullying. Fostering a sense of community, Red Balloon combines academia, counselling and PSHE to help students overcome their trauma and re-engage with mainstream schooling. At our homely Cambridge centre, students can be found cooking, playing the piano, re-enacting Macbeth or even dissecting lambs’ hearts! Others, either too far or too frightened to attend the centre in person, take part in our Red Balloon of the Air programme, learning in an interactive classroom from the safety of their home. Students make impressive progress, both academically and personally, taking tiny steps towards the bright futures they deserve.</p>

        <p><strong>Fellows & Staff Ticketing</strong> runs from 29th January, 7pm to 4th February, 7pm. Clare College Fellows and Staff may apply for one personal ticket and up to one guest ticket. A free queue jump upgrade is included for all fellows, staff and their guests. Applications should be made via this ticketing website.</p>
        <p><strong>Alumni Ticketing</strong> runs until 15th February, 7pm. Clare College Alumni may apply for one personal ticket and up to one guest ticket. Applications should be made by email to <a href="mailto:alumni_ticketing@claremayball.com">alumni_ticketing@claremayball.com</a></p>
